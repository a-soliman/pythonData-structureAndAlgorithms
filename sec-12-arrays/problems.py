# Anagram Check

'''
Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can 
be written using the exact same letters (so you just rearrange the letters to get the diffrent phrase or word).

FOR EXAMPLE:
      'public relations' is an anagram of 'crap built on lies.'
      'client eastwood' is an anagram of 'old west action'

- ignore spaces and capitalizations
